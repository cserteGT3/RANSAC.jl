# NEWS

In this file I keep track of the changes from release to release.

## v0.2.0

I removed some undocumented features (reconstructing translational surfaces) that had unregistered dependencies.
This way I don't have to check in the Manifest.

## v0.1.0

First release. The code is in the state as I finished my master's thesis.
Documentation is still WIP.

### v0.1.1

Finishing touches to the documentation.
