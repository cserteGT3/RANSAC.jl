# Introducing a new primitive shape

!!! danger "WIP!"
    This is currently work in progress, not yet working. This page is primarily a documentation for myself.

A primitive must define the following functions:
- `strt()`
- a constructor that acceppts a dictionary with string keys, which keys match the fieldnames.
