\begin{abstract}

The Efficient RANSAC algorithm\cite{effRANSAC} is a specialized version of the Random Sample Consensus algorithm designed for three dimensional point clouds.
It is capable of recognizing simple primitive shapes from point clouds with associated surface normals thus being a building block for digital shape reconstruction processes.
The RANSAC.jl package implements the Efficient RANSAC algorithm in pure Julia expanding the fields covered by Julia.
